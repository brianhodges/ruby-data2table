# Output Data Object/Array into Formatted Table (Ruby)
Just a project more for myself to refer back to when working on future Ruby projects. Outputs an array of objects into a formatted terminal table.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/ruby-data2table
  cd ruby-data2table
  ruby ruby-data2table.rb
  ```
*Data will instantly output formatted to Terminal/Console*
